# Robot Arena Game

The game is a Java-based application featuring a strategic interaction between robots and walls. Robots, initialized with unique attributes, move randomly towards a citadel on a grid. Walls, with health attributes, can be weakened over time. The GUI, implemented using SwingArena, displays the game elements and facilitates user interactions. The game involves coordinating robot movements, managing wall health, and strategically navigating the grid. The overarching goal is likely to guide robots to a citadel while dealing with wall challenges. The application offers a visually engaging experience with graphical representation and user-friendly interactions.
